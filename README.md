**Background**
Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return 
back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return 
back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of 
over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, 
environmental and health issues. 

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by
these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration
of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

**Data Set**
Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions, precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors. The core data set is related to the two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA which is publicly available in http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. We aggregated the data on two hourly and daily basis and then extracted and added the corresponding weather and seasonal information. Weather information are extracted from http://www.freemeteo.com. 

**Associated tasks**
- Regression: 
	Predication of bike rental count hourly or daily based on the environmental and seasonal settings.
- Event and Anomaly Detection:  
	Count of rented bikes are also correlated to some events in the town which easily are traceable via search engines.
	For instance, query like "2012-10-30 washington d.c." in Google returns related results to Hurricane Sandy. Some of the important events are identified in [1]. Therefore the data can be used for validation of anomaly or event detection algorithms as well.

**Data set**
- hour.csv : bike sharing counts aggregated on hourly basis. Records: 17379 hours
- day.csv - bike sharing counts aggregated on daily basis. Records: 731 days

**Dataset characteristics**	
Both hour.csv and day.csv have the following fields, except hr which is not available in day.csv
* instant: record index
* dteday : date
* season : season (1:springer, 2:summer, 3:fall, 4:winter)
* yr : year (0: 2011, 1:2012)
* mnth : month ( 1 to 12)
* hr : hour (0 to 23)
* holiday : weather day is holiday or not (extracted from http://dchr.dc.gov/page/holiday-schedule)
* weekday : day of the week
* workingday : if day is neither weekend nor holiday is 1, otherwise is 0.
* weathersit : 
	- 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy
	- 2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist
	- 3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds
	- 4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog
* temp : Normalized temperature in Celsius. The values are divided to 41 (max)
* atemp: Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius. The values are divided to 50 (max)
* hum: Normalized humidity. The values are divided to 100 (max)
* windspeed: Normalized wind speed. The values are divided to 67 (max)
* casual: count of casual users
* registered: count of registered users
* cnt: count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered

## Implementation Approach
### Architecture

### Build Model 
* Sigmoid activation function
### Backward Pass
* Batch Weight Change
* Updating the weights : Updates to both the input-to-hidden and hidden-to-output weights
### Forward Pass 
* Forward Pass
### Hyperparameter Tuning
* Number of epochs: 15000 , Tried between 50 and 15000
* Number of hidden units: 15, Tried between 5 and 100
* Learning rate: 0.15, Tried between 0.05 and 5
* Output nodes: 1 There is only one output needed 
Experimented changing each hyperparameter exclusively. When increasing epochs, the loss decreases though, I've tried to optimize the difference between training loss and validation loss would be the minimal. The bigger epochs could fall into overfitting, the bigger hidden units as well. To generalize model, I chose hidden units 15 to make the model more general to avoid overfitting. Bigger learning rate can fall into osciating results, so that I tried smaller learning rates. 
### Final Results
The training loss is below 0.09 and the validation loss is below 0.18. Here are the performance graph of training loss and validation loss.

## Prediction result
![testing result](prediction.png)
Regarding to miss predicting data, there is a strong correlation between bike renting and seansoal data such as weather or holiday season. From Dec 22 to Dec 31, especially it's Christmas season, and data does not show similar pattern before/after Dec. 22. However, prediction model is trained/optimized based on normal days so that, unusual/unseen pattern cannot be accurately predictable. To improve this model,"holiday" value from two csv files should be adjusted before christmas till new years day or "seasonint" value should be adjusted to reflect "special holiday seanson" from Chirstmas even to New Years Eve. Further more At least a couple more years data collection would be helpful to predict christmas holiday rental pattern.
